## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Press the play button to run chunks of code.
-------------------------------------------------
# Clear environment and load library
```{r}
# Clear environment 
rm(list=ls())

# Load necessary library
library(dplyr)
```


# Set the path to the folder containing your CSV files
```{r}
#folder_path <- "path/to/your/folder"

##Note: if you have a backslash - double down (\\)

 folder_path <- "N:\\RStor\\CEMML\\EdwardsAFB\\Mohave_Ground_Squirrel\\Camera_Images\\AnimalCaptures\\Mohave Ground Squirrel\\_CSVs"
```

# Get a list of all CSV files in the folder
```{r}
#csv_files <- list.files(path = folder_path, pattern = "\\.csv$", full.names = TRUE)

csv_files <- list.files(path = folder_path, pattern = "\\.csv$", full.names = TRUE)
```

```{r}

```


#Bind
```{r}
# Read and combine all CSV files into one data frame
#master_data <- csv_files %>%
  #lapply(read.csv, stringsAsFactors = FALSE, ColClasses = 'character') %>%
  #bind_rows()

##Note: Column classes are being changes to character because I have multiple character strings in corresponding columns. Therefore, I'm changing it all to character for merging purposes and can easily change classes (to binary) after the merge.
 
MGS_master_data <- csv_files %>%
  lapply(read.csv, stringsAsFactors = FALSE, colClasses = "character") %>%
  bind_rows()
```

#Create new CSV
```{r}
# Save the combined data to a new CSV file
#write.csv(master_data, file = "path/to/your/master_file.csv", row.names = FALSE)

write.csv(MGS_master_data, file = "N:\\RStor\\CEMML\\EdwardsAFB\\Mohave_Ground_Squirrel\\GIS_and_Monitoring_Data\\2024\\Field Data\\MGS_master_file.csv", row.names = FALSE)
 
# Print confirmation message
cat("Master CSV file created successfully!")
```

Fin.
